### Name
**YouTube Shorts Limiter**

### Summary (150 characters max)
Control your YouTube Shorts consumption with customizable daily limits and impossible-to-miss full-screen reminders.

### Description

Help yourself maintain healthy viewing habits with YouTube Shorts Limiter!

**ðŸŽ¯ Features:**

â€¢ **Customizable Limits** - Set your own daily Shorts limit (1-100) in the settings
â€¢ **Full-Screen Overlays** - Beautiful, impossible-to-miss reminders when you reach your limit
â€¢ **Smart Tracking** - Counts unique videos only, no double-counting
â€¢ **Visual Progress** - See your daily count with a beautiful popup interface
â€¢ **Gentle Reminders** - Get a reminder every 5 Shorts after exceeding your limit
â€¢ **Daily Reset** - Counter automatically resets every 24 hours
â€¢ **Privacy First** - All data stored locally, nothing sent to external servers

**How It Works:**

1. Install the extension
2. Set your preferred daily limit in Settings (default is 10)
3. Browse YouTube Shorts normally
4. When you reach your limit, a full-screen overlay appears
5. Choose to leave Shorts or continue watching (with reminders)

**Perfect for:**
- Breaking doomscrolling habits
- Managing screen time
- Maintaining focus and productivity
- Practicing digital wellness

The extension only tracks Shorts you haven't seen before, so rewatching doesn't count against your limit. All tracking is done locally in your browser - your viewing habits stay private.

Take control of your YouTube Shorts consumption today!
