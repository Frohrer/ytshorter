./package.sh

unzip -l youtube-shorts-limiter-1.0.0.zip

## Common Issues

### Icons not showing
- Make sure PNG files are in root directory
- Check manifest.json points to correct filenames
- Firefox store requires PNG, not SVG

### ZIP too large
- Remove unnecessary files (README, docs, etc.)
- package.sh already excludes them

### Manifest validation errors
- Use https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/manifest-v2/
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Check JSON syntax is valid
